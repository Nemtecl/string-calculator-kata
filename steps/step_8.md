# Step 8

Allow multiple delimiters like this: `"//[delim1][delim2]\n"`

for example `"//[*][%]\n1*2%3"` should return `6`.

Hints:

- Start with the **simplest** test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
- Remember to solve things as **simply** as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
- Remember to **refactor** after each passing test
