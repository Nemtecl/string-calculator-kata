# Step 5

Calling `add` with a negative number will throw an exception `"negatives not allowed"` - and the negative that was passed. 

if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.

Hints:

- Start with the **simplest** test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
- Remember to solve things as **simply** as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
- Remember to **refactor** after each passing test
