# Step 7

Delimiters can be of any length with the following format: `"//[delimiter]\n"` for example: `"//[***]\n1***2***3"` should return `6`

- Remember to solve things as **simply** as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
- Remember to **refactor** after each passing test
