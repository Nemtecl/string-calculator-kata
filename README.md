# string-calculator-kata

## What we will do

The String Calculator kata was originally created by Roy Osherove.

Itâ€™s a TDD kata.

The idea is to practice TDD cycles in pairs, taking small steps, running the tests often, and switching often who writes the tests and who writes the production code.

## The 3 golden rules of TDD

#1: You must write a **failing** test **before** you write any production code.

#2: You must not write more of a **test** than is sufficient to **fail**, or fail to compile.

#3: You must not write more **production** code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test **pass**.

## Before you start

- Try not to read ahead. The 9 steps of the kata are available here. Start with step_1 and move on as you complete each step.

- Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.

- Make sure you only test for **correct inputs**. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata

## Let's gooo

don't forget to `yarn`

run the tests with `yarn test` (it's already in watch mode)

keep in mind that this is a simple nodejs setup, use `require` instead of `import` ;)

Start with [step 1](./steps/step_1.md)
